- Steps to reproduce it
- Any relevant proof-of-concept code
- The potential impact or affected components

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge your report within **3 business days**.
- We will investigate and confirm the issue.
- If a fix is needed, we‚Äôll prepare a patch and may issue a **GitHub Security Advisory** (and CVE if applicable).
- We‚Äôll keep you informed throughout the process and credit you if appropriate.

We appreciate your efforts in keeping our project and its users safe.

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

When conducting security research and reporting vulnerabilities, we request that you:

- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
- Only interact with accounts or data that you own or have explicit permission to access.
- Limit the amount of data you access or download to the minimum necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Do not use a vulnerability to gain persistent access to systems or exfiltrate sensitive information.
- Report the vulnerability to us as soon as you discover it.
- Allow us a reasonable timeframe to investigate, fix, and announce the vulnerability before making it public.

## Supported Versions

We only provide security updates for the **latest stable release**. Make sure you're up-to-date.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be authorized. If you make a good faith effort to discover and report vulnerabilities by following these guidelines, we will not initiate legal action against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you. If any third party initiates legal action against you related to research conducted under this policy, we will make it known that your actions were authorized by us.
